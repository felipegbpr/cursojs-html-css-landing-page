      <h2>top 3 jobs</h2>
      <p>Getting that all-important first developer job isn't easy, especially if you're a self-taught programmer without university-provided career services or internships.</p>
      <p>As the founder of a code-learning platform, I have witnessed hundreds of people globally make a successful break into the tech industry, many of whom had no CS degree or support from a school. Those who succeed often use non-obvious strategies that go beyond the conventional advice of crafting a solid resume, building a portfolio, writing a cover letter and so forth.</p>
      <p>One of the most effective strategies is to combine your previous professional experience with your newly acquired coding skills. This works well because companies prefer hiring candidates who have industry knowledge, understand their customers' needs, and are easier to onboard. Another benefit is that it's likely easier for you to find someone who can give you a warm referral if you already have a network in the given industry.</p>
